Possible notations for squares:

Forward directions are numbers, all else are letters; Z is Greek.
5D: (v)(w)(z)(y)(x)    i.e. a1αa1, c2δb4
4D: (z)(w)(y)(x)    i.e. α1a1, β3d4
3D: (z)(y)(x)    i.e. αa1, βc4

Vectors.
[x,y,z,w,v]        i.e. [1,1,1,1,1], [4,2,4,2,3]

Timeline+turn notations are same as in standard 5D chess: prepend Tx(+/-)xL   i.e. T2+0L, T6-1L
